Repository for remote monitoring project

To Do:

**1. MQTT to InfluxDB:**
   - Refer to this example. It has callback functions for On-MQTT-Connect and On-MQTT-Messages received.
     https://github.com/rub-a-dub-dub/mqtt-influxdb/blob/master/mqtt-influxdb.py
   - Use the public m2m.Eclipse.org MQTT broker for testing first.
   - Set up private MQTT broker later.     
   - The above example uses the InfluxDB Python client plugin. Refer to:
     http://influxdb-python.readthedocs.io/en/latest/api-documentation.html as well as
     example in https://github.com/tzewantp/remote_eyes/blob/master/gateway/influxapp/flux_test1.py.


**2. Setting up of private broker in Ubuntu:**
   - Refer to the following link:
     http://howtoprogram.xyz/2016/10/15/install-mosquitto-mqtt-broker-ubuntu-16-04-lts-xenial-xerus/
     http://wingsquare.com/blog/setting-up-mqtt-mosquitto-broker-in-ubuntu-linux/

**3. Setting up Chronograf or Grafana for data visualisation:**
   - Refer to:
     http://coendegroot.com/grafana-influxdb-and-python-simple-sample/

**4. Receiving of XBee messages on BeagleBone:**
   - Refer to the following example:
     https://github.com/tzewantp/remote_eyes/blob/master/gateway/xbee/receive_sample.py

**5. Writing the Pulse Generator:** 
   - Write a simple serial terminal program (controlled from PC) to control how the hardware should respond to commands from the PC.
   - The following example uses the **mbed asynchronous APIs**:
     https://developer.mbed.org/teams/SiliconLabs/wiki/Using-the-mbed-asynchronous-APIs
     This API makes use of asynchronous event handling through the serial channel.
     
     Note: It is tested on the STM32F401RE board, but not yet on the STM32F042K6 board.
     
     Sample program: https://github.com/tzewantp/remote_eyes/blob/master/embedded/pulse_generator/async_serial.cpp
     
**6. BeagleBone Networking:** 
   - BeagleBone Black /etc/network/interfaces file should look like this:
    
     iface usb0 inet static
     
     address 192.168.7.2
     
     netmask 255.255.255.0
     
     network 192.168.7.0
     
     gateway 192.168.7.1
     
   - This file - /etc/resolv.conf should be modified as such:
   
     nameserver 8.8.8.8
     
     nameserver 8.8.4.4
   
   - Check the route using the command: route -n
     If the gateway (192.168.7.1) is not shown, add with:
     
     route add default gw 192.168.7.1

   - Finally, ping "www.google.com" to see if the URL could be resolved by the nameserver.
